# Local development, testing, and deployment

## One-time maintainer checklist

These control-plane steps require a human project owner:

1. Install and start Docker Desktop. Allocate enough memory for the local
   Supabase stack.
2. Use Node 22:

   ```bash
   nvm install
   nvm use
   corepack enable
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

3. Authenticate and link the Supabase CLI:

   ```bash
   pnpm exec supabase login
   pnpm exec supabase link --project-ref hzkwaecgggkjikwlvghi
   ```

4. Confirm the production database major version with `show server_version;`.
   If it differs from `major_version = 17` in `supabase/config.toml`, update the
   committed local setting before relying on migration replay.
5. Rotate and verify Gemini using [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
6. Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel, set Node.js 22, add the non-secret
   `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=1` variable to Development, Preview, and
   Production, and configure only
   these browser-safe variables for Preview and Production:

   ```dotenv
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://hzkwaecgggkjikwlvghi.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
   ```

7. Create protected GitHub environments named `preview` and `production`.
   Configure:

   - Repository/environment variable `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - Repository/environment variable `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - Environment secret `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - Preview secrets `E2E_EMAIL` and `E2E_PASSWORD` for a dedicated test user

Protect the `production` environment with required reviewer approval. Never add
the Gemini key, Supabase service-role key, database password, or E2E password to
a `VITE_*` variable.

## Configure Google sign-in

Google sign-in requires one OAuth client in Google Cloud and must be enabled in
the Supabase dashboard before the button can authenticate users:

1. Create a **Web application** OAuth client in Google Cloud.
2. Add the app origins you use, including `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and the
   production and preview Vercel origins.
3. Add Supabase's hosted callback as an authorized redirect URI:

   ```text
   https://hzkwaecgggkjikwlvghi.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```

4. In Supabase, open **Authentication → Providers → Google**, enable the
   provider, and save the Google client ID and client secret.
5. In **Authentication → URL Configuration**, allow the production URL,
   localhost URL, and the Vercel preview URL pattern used by this project.

The Google client secret belongs only in Supabase. Do not put it in `.env.local`,
Vercel, a `VITE_*` variable, or the repository. Local Supabase OAuth can be added
later with a separate development-only Google client; it is not enabled by the
committed local configuration so contributors without Google credentials can
still start the local stack.

## Run the frontend against hosted Supabase

This is the shortest path when you only need the UI:

```bash
nvm use
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in the hosted project's public URL and publishable key, then:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080>.

## Run the entire product locally

The local backend is a real Supabase stack—Postgres, Auth, PostgREST, Storage,
Studio, and the local email viewer—rather than a database mock. It is intended
only for localhost development and testing.

First configure the server-only Gemini key:

```bash
cp supabase/.env.example supabase/.env.local
```

Replace the placeholder in `supabase/.env.local`, then start and initialize:

```bash
pnpm supabase:start
pnpm db:reset
pnpm env:local
pnpm e2e:user:local
pnpm dev:local
```

Open:

- App: <http://127.0.0.1:8080>
- Supabase Studio: <http://127.0.0.1:54323>
- Local email viewer: <http://127.0.0.1:54324>

`env:local` creates a private `.env.local` from the running local stack.
`e2e:user:local` creates or refreshes two localhost-only users and writes their
private credentials plus the local email-viewer URL to `.env.e2e.local`. Both
environment files are ignored by Git.

For UI and authentication work on a resource-constrained machine, start only
Postgres, Auth, PostgREST, the API gateway, and the local email viewer:

```bash
pnpm dev:local:auth
```

This command starts the lightweight Docker-backed Supabase stack, regenerates
`.env.local`, and starts the app. New accounts still require confirmation; open
<http://127.0.0.1:54324> to follow the local confirmation link. Use the full
stack above when testing Storage, Studio, Realtime, or Edge Functions.

If you do not need local AI functions, run `pnpm dev` after `env:local`
instead of `dev:local`. Stop the stack without deleting its data:

```bash
pnpm supabase:stop
```

## Test commands

The canonical suite and CI command reference is
[`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md). The commands below are the common shortcuts.

### Fast gate

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm audit
```

This runs lint, application and Playwright type-checking, unit tests,
infrastructure invariant checks, and the production build.

### Public browser product tests

Install Chromium once:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:public
```

This suite starts Vite automatically and does not require a real backend.

### Disposable database and RLS tests

With Docker running:

```bash
pnpm supabase:start:test
pnpm db:reset
pnpm db:test
pnpm db:lint
```

`db:reset` destroys only the local test database, replays every committed
migration, and applies `supabase/seed.sql`. `db:test` runs the pgTAP schema and
cross-user RLS suite transactionally. Never add `--linked` when working with the
production project.

### Authenticated local product tests

After `supabase:start`, `env:local`, and `e2e:user:local`:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:local
```

That performs real local Auth and course CRUD. For the complete local Gemini
journey, keep `pnpm supabase:functions` running in another terminal and run:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:local:full
```

### Deployed product tests

Use the **Live product verification** GitHub workflow, or run:

```bash
E2E_BASE_URL=https://your-preview.vercel.app \
E2E_EMAIL=studyup-e2e@example.com \
E2E_PASSWORD="$STUDYUP_E2E_PASSWORD" \
pnpm test:e2e:live --project=chromium
```

## Deploy Supabase changes

Review before changing a hosted database:

```bash
pnpm supabase:deploy:check
```

After review:

```bash
pnpm supabase:deploy
```

The second command applies pending migrations and deploys both authenticated Edge
Functions. Gemini secrets are managed separately because secret rotation should
never be implicit in an application deployment.

## Deploy Vercel

The recommended default is Vercel's Git integration: pull requests receive
preview deployments and merging the protected production branch creates a
production deployment.

For a reproducible manual deployment, run the **Deploy Vercel** GitHub workflow.
It:

1. Runs every repository quality gate.
2. Pulls the selected Vercel environment configuration.
3. Builds a prebuilt artifact.
4. Deploys exactly that artifact to Preview or Production.

Production uses the protected GitHub environment approval. Reports and backend
source are excluded from frontend uploads through `.vercelignore`.

Local CLI equivalents are:

```bash
pnpm vercel:link
pnpm vercel:pull
pnpm vercel:build
pnpm deploy:preview
```

Production is always explicit:

```bash
pnpm deploy:production
```

## Hosted testing database option

For pull-request environments, enable Supabase Branching through the Supabase
GitHub integration with working directory `.` and automatic branching. Each
preview branch is isolated and receives migrations, functions, Auth, Storage,
and the non-sensitive `supabase/seed.sql`; production data is not copied.

Use hosted preview branches when a PR needs a shareable full-stack environment.
Use the local disposable stack for fast CI migration/RLS tests. Keep both:
preview branches test cloud configuration, while local replay catches migration
and RLS regressions without persistent infrastructure cost.
